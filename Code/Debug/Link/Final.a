;//using a dotmatrix[Common Cathode]:
;//  A DotMatrix(8x8) is a matrix of LEDs in 8 columns and 8 rows.
;//  It has Two sets of pins:
;//    set 1 -> A-H : pins of A to H are for rows
;//    set 2 -> 1-8 : pins of 1 to 8 are for columns
;//  when you try to light an specific LED, first you need to declear its COLUMN status.
;//  so, you HIGH(3V-5V-VCC) the column number you want and LOW(0-GND) the other ones to
;//  not set the other ones ON on a single row.
;//  then, you LOW(0-GND) the row you desire and HIGH(3V-5V-VCC) the otherones so in a column,
;//  so there is no other rows on.
;//
;//  here is the plan: we have a display_clean function, which sets the columns to LOW and rows
;//  to HIGHT
;//  DDRB = DDRD = 0xFF
;//  ROWS[LOW] : PORTB = 0x00
;//  COLUMN[HIGH] : PORTD = 0xFF
;//
;//  example :
;//  row 3 column 1 and 2:
;//  COLUMNS : 0b11000000
;//  ROWS    : 0b11011111
